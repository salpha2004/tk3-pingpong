# tk3-pingpong
TK3's first assignment: Ping Pong game repository

Project: create a ping-pong game, initially playable by up to 4 people inside a rectangular frame. Later on maybe more players in more complicated shapes (like a hexagon), which might also be rotating!

Some rules and notes:
- The ball increases speed (either with time as it passes, or number of bumps as it increases) to make the game more exciting.
- Moving bars is done via tilting on Android and arrow keys on PC.
- Each player has 3 lifes and the surviver is the winner in the end.
- Different colors for bars are used to denote different opponents.
- The player who has hosted the game can press the start button and the game will start appropriately based on number of players that have joined.

*Please make a seperate branch for each subtask (Android, PC) and leave the master branch for the final version.*
